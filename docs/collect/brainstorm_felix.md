# Brainstorm By FÃ©lix
One punch man deep dive.

## Design
2008 JARVIS-esque hyper-futuristic cybernetic.

## Programming Languages
We'll be using languages we know, such as PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS. Maybe Javascript aswell.

## Case
- Elo could be used with math formulas.
- Leaderboard can be done with Javascript, database is not really needed.
- Hero registration needs several forms for information.
